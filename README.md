## Overview

This is my learning notes when studying spidering website content. Thanks to [Jikexueyuan](http://www.jikexueyuan.com/path/python/). It is a very good website for programming language learning.

This serie contains both basic and advanced knowledge of spider technology.

It is classified into several sections
### [Basics](https://github.com/nickzylove/spider/blob/master/basic.md)
### [Xpath](https://github.com/nickzylove/spider/blob/master/xpath.md)
### [Simulation_login](https://github.com/nickzylove/spider/blob/master/simulation_login.md)
